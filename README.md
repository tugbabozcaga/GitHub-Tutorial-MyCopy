# GitHub-Tutorial

## Some pre-workshop instructions: 

- We’ll work with R Studio but I suppose you all have it. If you don’t, you can use another text editor that can create files with any of the following extensions: .txt, .do, .R, .md. 

- Download and install the GitHub Desktop app.

- Create a Github.com account and username.

- Optional: Get a free Github student pack. Public repositories are free.  But to keep your repositories private, you need to either pay or confirm you’re a student.
